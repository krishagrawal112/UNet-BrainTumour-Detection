# UNet-BrainTumour-Detection
Coursework for 3rd year module COMP60006: Computer Vision

## Description
A U-net was created with the appropriate encoder and decoder paths. The model was trained and tested on a brain tumour detection dataset. The project involved visualising the dataset, implementing a class and member functions to load data for training/testing, building teh U-net architecture and deploying it on the test set.


## Dataset
The dataset for the project can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zmytk2yu284af6t/Task01_BrainTumour_2D.tar.gz
